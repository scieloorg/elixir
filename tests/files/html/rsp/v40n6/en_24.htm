hospitalize a nursing home elderly resident is multifactorial and
it is based on factors such as illness severity and care facility
infrastructure. Hospitalizations have benefits and risks such

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Long-term care facilities for the elderly are often known by
different names such as rehabilitation home, nursing home, and
geriatric clinic. Most have regularly to work together with
general hospitals when one of their residents needs to be
hospitalized. Moving patients is backed by the fact that
traditionally hospitals can treat acutely ill patients and are
able to provide all together more complex diagnostic procedures
and/or multi-specialty care. However, an attending physician who
is well-trained and qualified to medical care for nursing home
residents is able to manage a wide range of diseases and specific
conditions found in this group.<sup>39,45</sup> Nursing home
staff should also be able to provide several different procedures
to the elderly, from intravenous drug administration to hospice
care.<sup>17</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision to hospitalize a nursing home resident is
multifactorial and it is based on factors such as illness
severity, care facility infrastructure, family and/or patient's
request and financial needs. It always requires a careful
consideration of the hospitalization benefits and risks, such as
iatrogenic diseases, delirium, and functional decline, which
could aggravate the patient's general condition and quality of
life during and/or after their admission. Bearing that in mind,
the present article was aimed at addressing specific aspects of
the assessment, treatment, and management of nursing home elderly
residents during hospital admissions, especially focusing on
their effective care.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>HOSPITALIZED 
  NURSING HOME RESIDENTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazilian population 
  aged 60 years or more have rapidly increased both numerically and in survival 
  years in recent decades. This age group accounts for around 10% of the entire 
  population and for about 20% of all Brazilian Health System (SUS) hospital admission 
  authorizations (AIH). A gradually increasing need for hospital beds and long-term 
  care facilities the elderly is expected in the years to come.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#back2"><sup>**</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nursing home residents have a different profile compared to
other hospitalized patients. They are usually much older than
those elderly living in the community, aging on average about 80
years.<sup>9,30,37</sup> They suffer greatly from diseases and
physical and psychosocial disabilities.<sup>37</sup> Although
they can sometimes be admitted due to vague complaints, symptoms
such as fever and altered mental status (delirium) are related to
precipitating diseases. Among common major causes for
hospitalization of nursing home residents are cardiovascular,
respiratory, and neurological diseases, traumas, bone fractures
and infections, especially urinary infections and
bronchopneumonias.<sup>15,21,33,36</sup> These patients are
likely to stay longer in hospital and usually have higher rates
of complications and mortality.<sup>8,14,21,26,27,30,41</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides the management of the precipitating diseases, nursing
home residents require more attention and care during their
hospitalization. They have high risk of concomitantly developing
processes of physical, functional, and psychosocial
deterioration. Polypharmacy, other iatrogenic diseases and
delirium are of major concern and their potential risk should
always be assessed during hospitalization. States of functional
decline are often seen and include clinical manifestations such
as urinary incontinence and gait disturbances.<sup>36</sup> Poor
nutrition and weight loss can occur and/or be detected during
their admission. Hospital stay should also be used as an
opportunity for planning subsequent treatments and/or hospice
care. Periodic assessment of factors associated to these
conditions helps the evaluation and management of nursing home
residents while they are hospitalized.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Delirium</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Acute confusional state or delirium is a syndrome commonly
seen in hospitalized elderly, occurring in 5 to 55% of older
hospitalized patients and around 16% of those patients admitted
in emergency care services.<sup>34</sup> Delirium is
characterized by acute changes of attention, cognition, and the
level of consciousness, progressing with fluctuations and
exacerbated symptoms during the night.<sup>6</sup> Usually
originated by multiple factors, delirium often goes misdiagnosed
and/or mistreated, resulting in increased hospital stay and
morbidity and mortality.<sup>25,30</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assessment scales and semi-structured interviews have been
developed to help health providers to diagnose and first approach
delirium patients.<sup>44</sup> The Confusion Assessment Method
(CAM) has become the most widely used instrument, and the
Brazilian translated version shows 94.1% sensitivity and 96.4%
specificity.<sup>13,28</sup> The management of delirium patients
includes identifying and treating precipitating conditions, such
as infections, drugs, water and electrolyte disturbances,
ischemic heart disease, pain and bone fratures.<sup>20,40</sup>
Preventive measures are aimed at identifying risk factors and
minimizing precipitating events. Visually- and/or
hearing-impaired patients, those with cognitive impairments,
severely decompensated diseases, and high blood nitrogen
urea/serum creatinine ratio should be considered more susceptible
to developing delirium.<sup>25,26</sup> Precipitating factors are
frequently seen during hospitalizations and they include drug
side effects, procedures, infections, sleep deprivation and
forced immobilization.<sup>20</sup> Patient's escorts should be
familiarized with delirium, thus making early diagnosis more
likely and reducing common knowledge that confusional states are
common among the elderly. Having their acquaintances to stay with
them during the day and the night will help prevent and/or reduce
the course and severity of patient's delirium.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Delirium signs and symptoms can linger on after patient's
hospital discharge and many of them are misdiagnosed as senile
dementia patients. Increased disability in activities of daily
living such as dressing, showering/bathing or eating is also
common.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A significant proportion of delirium patients have behavioral
disorders, for instance, restlessness. In these cases, initial
treatment should include support measures, guidance, and
management and/or reduction of risk factors and precipitating
conditions. Symptomatic treatment may be necessary when support
measures have no effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Drugs and other iatrogenic diseases</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The elderly show high risk of drug side effects either
resulting or not from drug interactions. Drug side effects are
twice to three times more likely to occur in the elderly than in
young adults as well as more frequently seen and severe during
hospitalizations.<sup>31</sup> Increased side effects are due to
the aging process that causes changes in body buildup, drug
kinetics and dynamics and high prevalence of polypharmacy, i.e.,
concomitant use of five or more drugs.<sup>19,22</sup> Systematic
review of drug history and careful introduction of new drugs are
good clinical practices, especially when there is a temporal
association between medication and symptom onset. Another
alternative is to follow the guidelines for drug selection to
elderly treatment, such as Beers',<sup>2</sup> and Beers et
al<sup>1</sup> criteria updated by Fick et al,<sup>16</sup>
bearing in mind that they do not comprise all Brazilian
pharmacopeia.<sup>23</sup> Dose changes or discontinuation of
medication taken by nursing home residents can precipitate side
effects but can be reduced through a collaborative elderly care
program between institutions.<sup>5</sup> The actual need of each
drug prescribed should be assessed to avoid polypharmacy during
and after hospitalization.<sup>22,35</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iatrogenic complications in hospitalized elderly generally
occur due to both inadequate medication treatment and diagnostic
and therapeutic procedures. Iatrogenic diseases can be
preventable in many patients as their definition also includes
events related to the length of hospital stay and/or hospital
environment, such as bed sore ulcers, falls, and bone
fractures.<sup>8</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Decreased functional ability, such as eating and walking
without assistance, is frequently seen among hospitalized elderly
and is associated to cognitive deficits, delirium and low
functional ability at the time of hospital admission, very common
finding in nursing home residents.<sup>10,11,41</sup> As
decreased functional ability is also strongly associated to
iatrogenic complications, its early detection is thus the best
preventive action to reduce inadequate procedures and
treatments.<sup>32</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nutritional assessment and poor nutrition</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nutritional status 
  of elderly patients needs to be regularly evaluated, especially during hospitalizations. 
  Poor nutrition, a common severe condition in this age group, usually goes underdiagnosed. 
  Protein-energy undernutrition among hospitalized elderly leads to longer hospital 
  stay, increased mortality and complications such as infections and bed sore 
  ulcers. At admission, nutritional evaluation of nursing home elderly frequently 
  show significantly poorer markers <i>&#150;</i> history of weight loss, signs 
  of dehydration, low body mass index, serum albumin and cholesterol, hemoglobin 
  and lymphocyte counts <i>&#150;</i> compared to elderly living in the community. 
  Poor nutritional status in this population is likely to result from their high 
  rates of co-morbidities, polypharmacy, and disability in activities of daily 
  living.<sup>24,29,38,42</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Functional decline</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A significantly high proportion of nursing home residents show
difficulties in activities of daily living, such as dressing,
walking and being continent.<sup>37,43</sup> On the other hand,
functional declines during hospitalizations occur not only as a
result of their diseases per se but also due to iatrogenic
interventions, immobilization and loss of physical fitness.
Hospitalizations tend to increase their level of disability and
extend their rehabilitation afterwards.<sup>41</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elderly functional ability should be assessed at hospital
admission and regularly during hospital stay to identify and
prevent disabilities and implement early rehabilitation. Their
functional assessment includes activities of daily living as well
as cognitive dysfunctions, urinary incontinence and signs of lack
of mobility, for example, bed sore ulcers, balance and gait
disturbances. An existing association between these signs and
symptoms implies greater risk of deteriorating their inability
during and after hospitalization. Ideally, these problems require
a multidisciplinary approach where each provider would develop
preventive and therapeutic actions to reduce the average hospital
stay, and mortality and disability during and after
hospitalizations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Hospice care</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hospitalization of acutely ill elderly provides an opportunity
to reassess the patient's general condition, prognosis, and
treatment plans and goals. If a diagnosis of an advanced
end-stage disease is made, the assumption of cure is shifted to
hospice care. Hospital team can develop care plans based on these
patient's conditions and subsequently discuss their continuation
at the time these patients are being moved to long-term care
facilities.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>EVALUATION AND 
  CARE OF HOSPITALIZED NURSING HOME RESIDENTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nursing home residents have special needs during
hospitalizations. Their clinical evaluation and care process can
make a difference in the quality of in-hospital care provided to
them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Anamnesis</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Obtaining a complete medical history from nursing home
residents can be troublesome, and requires additional
investigations and patience. Admitted patients are often unable
to provide adequate information due to cognitive and/or mental
state impairment. Others are not able to provide information on
medication use and therapeutic schedules. In this context,
medical records are a major source of information and should
contain additional information obtained from providers originally
caring for these patients at their nursing home facilities. The
interaction between hospital and nursing home staff is essential
to determine the reasons for moving the patient to the hospital
as well as defining treatment plan. Relevant information, such as
the patient's prior physical and cognitive abilities, recent
changes in medications and history of falls can be obtained from
nursing home staff and medical providers. In any circumstance, it
is advisable to get in touch with the patient's family. One
should bear in mind that family members frequently experience
feelings of guilt and neglect and can potentially actually
display aggressive behaviors towards the hospital and nursing
home care team, and make threats and carry out verbal, physical,
and legal actions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Physical examination and additional evaluation</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vital signs should always be compared to those previously
recorded in the nursing home records. A helpful example is the
elderly basal temperature, which often ranges around
36ºC, so an increase of one degree or more may
indicate febrile states and support the investigation of
infectious processes.<sup>3</sup> Orthostatic hypotension can be
a sign of water or blood losses or even drug side
effects.<sup>21</sup> Heart arrhythmias require an ECG, which can
show acute atrial fibrillation, drug poisoning, and myocardial
ischemia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are important physical examination findings in these
patients. Skin should be inspected for bed sore ulcers, which may
help to establish the source of many febrile states and the
patient's functional status. Similarly, continuity solution,
ecchymosis, and bruising are suggestive of falls or abuse. Oral
lesions can be a source of infections and poor nutrition. Other
signs of poor nutrition such as reduced subcutaneous tissue and
muscle mass should be also examined as they are highly prevalent
among dementia patients and nursing home
residents.<sup>29,38,42</sup> A complete neurological examination
can help identify previously undetected stroke and Parkinson's
disease manifestations. Assessment scales such as
CAM<sup>13,28</sup> and the Mini Mental Status Examination
(MMSE)<sup>4,7,18</sup> help the diagnosis and first approach of
patients in confusional states and their cognitive
assessment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diagnostic hypotheses and abnormalities associated to aging
and the level of vulnerability of nursing home residents direct
the need for additional case-by-case examinations.<sup>12</sup>
Blood and urine cultures and chest X-rays are indicates in
febrile states as well as in suspected cases of delirium together
with biochemistry tests such as electrolytes and kidney and liver
function tests. Thyroid hormone measurements should often be
performed given the high prevalence of thyroid disorders in this
age group. The likelihood of inappropriate drug ingestion and
poisoning, which may require drug screening in the blood and/or
urine, should be also considered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Care</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the management and treatment of the cause for
hospitalization and control of preexisting diseases, permanent
care should be taken to minimize functional inabilities and
reduce iatrogenic diseases. Whenever possible, patients should be
encouraged to stay out of bed, which can help them to keep their
mobility and independence. This is also an opportunity for
patients to reestablish their activities of daily living such as
eating and to reduce their risk of orthostatic hypotension. Other
actions can be taken to prevent deep venous thrombosis, bed sore
ulcers, and intestinal constipation. According to the anticipated
date of discharge, the attending hospital team should help the
patient, together with the nursing home team, plan the required
arrangements for the patient's move back and continuation of the
treatment and care provided during hospitalization.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nursing home elderly comprise a special segment within this
age group. Even in the event of acute and/or severe conditions
requiring the infrastructure of a general hospital, preventive
actions to reduce complications and functional inabilities can be
implemented by hospital care team. Similarly, early diagnoses and
treatments of nursing home residents can help avoid many
hospitalizations. Population aging is a well-known ongoing
process and elderly care and interventions will be progressively
required in hospital and nursing home facilities. These settings
and their care teams do not have much time left to prepare to
care for the growing elderly population in the fast approaching
future.</font></p>
