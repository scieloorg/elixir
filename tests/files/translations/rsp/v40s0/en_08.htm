<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study evaluates the targets of the United Nations
Declaration on HIV/AIDS Resource Targets, the attainment of which
are premised on promoting three fronts: reduction of material and
services costs, increased efficiency in access to and management
of funds, and the channeling of new funds. Data were derived from
studies of National Accounts of HIV/AIDS in Latin America and the
Caribbean and from the recent available literature on the global
dynamics of HIV/AIDS resources. The economic concept of global
public good occurs throughout the text. The article discusses
factors that constrain funding, and thus compel the adoption of
new strategies in Brazil. The issues addressed include:
difficulties in maintaining the downward tendency in the cost of
items related to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the incorporation each
year of thousands of persons needing antiviral therapy, the rise
in patient survival and increased diagnosis for the control of
HIV/AIDS transmission. It is concluded that, in order to
guarantee additional resources to combat the epidemic, the
discussion on funding must necessarily focus on both the share of
AIDS support for the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and, more
importantly, on an increase in health funding as a whole. The
recognition that HIV/AIDS control contributes to the global
public good should facilitate increases in development assistance
from international funding sources.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The targets discussed in the financial resources chapter of
the United Nations Declaration on HIV/AIDS Resource Targets
deserve special attention because, without adequate funding to
address the dynamics of this epidemic, other targets can be
compromised.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally, targets emphasize the need to secure additional
funding to combat HIV/AIDS. This is particularly relevant in
countries where governmental capacity for financial assistance is
low. Although it is necessary, relying solely on channeling new
funds can be insufficient, given the nature and dimensions of the
HIV/AIDS problem.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are three basic economic strategies that can be adopted
to reduce financial limitations in the provision HIV/AIDS actions
and services:</font></p>

</table>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present article 
  evaluates and proposes action strategies in these three areas as a means to 
  reduce the gap between financial need and the resources available to combat 
  HIV/AIDS in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, the scope of the targets discussed in the
Declaration of Commitment of the United Nations General Assembly
on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) requires from Brazil specific actions and
commitments. Thus, the degree to which the targets can guide
public policies for the control of HIV/AIDS in the country will
also be evaluated.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ANALYSIS OF 
  THE UNGASS TARGETS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 11 targets set forth in the Resources Chapter of the
Declaration of Commitment of UNGASS are analyzed in an aggregated
manner. Through this, an attempt was made to answer the question:
How to secure sufficient funding to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic
(Target 1) and, more specifically, how to guarantee annual
resources of US$ 7 to 10 billion for countries of low and medium
per-capita income in 2005, as established by Target 2?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In answering this question, some targets are more closely
associated with the behavior of international funding sources. In
this group, the following parameters were analyzed: commitments
related to increased free HIV/AIDS assistance and official
development assistance (ODA) as a whole (Target 3); and support
for the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Target
9). Also discussed in relation to Target 3, are the extent of ODA
contributions relative to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of
developed countries (Target 5) and the ways to reach these levels
(Target 6). Additional resources derive from debt-forgiveness
initiatives for highly indebted countries and the cancellation of
official bilateral debt (Target 7). Finally, public funding and
the commitment to gradually increasing the percentage of national
budgets committed to HIV/AIDS (Target 4) were evaluated
separately.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The remaining targets were also analyzed in the work. Targets
10 and 11 relate to funds available from international
organizations that can assist countries in training schemes to
combat the epidemic. Target 8 addresses the necessity of
additional investments in HIV/AIDS research.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This work relied on data from National HIV/AIDS Accounts for
Latin America and the Caribbean.<sup>2</sup> These consist of the
systematic, periodic and exhaustive accounting of spending and
funding flow relating to the control of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It
aims to determine: the sum of resources destined to the
prevention and treatment of AIDS; the sources (public and
private, national and international) that provide funding; the
institutions that channel and manage the resources (as well as
those that benefit from them); the programs developed; and the
outlay.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study used information available in the recent literature
(1999-2005) concerning the global flow of HIV/AIDS resources. In
this respect, the scarcity of standardized data on funding and
expenses for HIV/AIDS, as well as their discontinuity, negatively
impact the efficiency of spending and decision-making at the
national and international levels.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As will be seen throughout the article, the proportion of the
HIV/AIDS contributions shared among public and private, national
and international sources is not solely conditioned on the
availability of resources. This also depends on the perception of
decision-makers concerning costs and benefits associated with the
prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. This question is clearly
related to the need for international collective action to fund
and promote global public goods.<sup>11</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A global public good is understood to mean any program, policy
or service that transcends national and regional boundaries.
Although there is common appeal in its benefits, there is no
interest in sharing its burdens by members of the
group.<sup>7</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevention and treatment of AIDS should be considered
global public goods, as both have a role in controlling the
epidemic. Arguably, treatment cannot be disassociated from
prevention programs because, as was noted previously, it has a
substantial impact on the transmission of HIV and on
understanding the serological status of the population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For these reasons, the concept of global public good permeates
this analysis and, furthermore, should occupy a privileged
position in HIV/AIDS funding debates conducted in national and,
primarily, international forums.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study from the World Health Organization (WHO) Commission on
Macroeconomy and Health<sup>16</sup> suggests that when nations
cooperate, the product is inferior to the interest of both
individual countries and the group as a whole.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ANALYSIS OF 
  FUNDING SOURCES</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), spending for combating HIV/AIDS in countries of low and
medium per-capita income totaled approximately US$ 4.7 billion in
2003.<sup>15</sup> Although representing an increase of 20% in
relation to 2002 and 500% relative to 1996, these outlays are
still considerably short of what is needed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Estimates suggest that funding on the scale of about US$ 6.3
billion was needed in 2003.<sup>15</sup> UNGASS calculated that
an investment of US$ 9.2 billion would have been necessary in
2005 for prevention, monitoring and treatment of
HIV/AIDS.<sup>9</sup> The Macroeconomy and Health Commission of
the WHO estimated a need for funding of between US$ 13.6 and 15.4
billion in 2007 and of between US$ 20.6 and 24.9 billion in 2015,
depending on eventual cover and costs.<sup>4</sup> Therefore,
according to these estimates, in less than fifteen years funding
to combat HIV/AIDS will need to increase fivefold.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agreed values included in Target 2 (US$ 7 to 10 billion)
are lower than the estimates proposed by UNGASS and those of the
Macroeconomy and Health Commission. For this parameter, amounts
represent the minimum total allocation for HIV/AIDS expenditures
in 2005.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to UNAIDS data, 34% of 2002 funding was contributed
by the seven wealthiest (G-7) countries; 18% from national
resources (including family outlay); 11% from the World Bank; 11%
from the private sector; 7% from foundations and NGOs; 4% from
the Global Fund; 5% from the United Nations; and 10% from donors
of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization
for Cooperation and Economic Development.<sup>14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As discussed previously, international donors have increased
their relative contributions to the fight against HIV/AIDS in
recent years. According to UNAIDS, these funds accounted for
approximately half of 2003 HIV/AIDS funding. In low and medium
per-capita income countries, HIV/AIDS funds generally originate
from international sources.<sup>15</sup> This fact highlights the
importance of these funds, and the modest contributions from
other sources, for defraying costs in poor countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In relation to 
  public funding of HIV/AIDS programs, data suggest there has been a significant 
  reduction in the contribution from national governments in recent years: from 
  49% in 1996 to 24% in 2003.<sup>15,11,</sup><a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  Two hypotheses may explain this apparent decline: methodological differences 
  across studies or a significant increase in recent international funding. The 
  latter may result from the implementation of the Global Fund and of the Multi-Country 
  AIDS Program (MAP) of the World Bank and the increase in bilateral donations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to an UNAIDS study<sup>15</sup> conducted in 58
countries, a relative reduction was observed in HIV/AIDS spending
by national governments in spite of a tendency for increased
contributions in absolute terms. This suggests that increased
funding from other sources has gradually replaced the efforts by
national governments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These studies highlight the unequal distribution of these
funds. According to UNAIDS<sup>12</sup> (1999), the proportion of
contributions from national governments to the fight against the
HIV/AIDS epidemic is substantially higher in Eastern European
countries (79%) and Latin America (67%) than in Sub-Saharan
Africa, where it is only 9%, and in the Caribbean, where it is
8%. Of the 64 countries included in this study, Brazil and
Thailand were responsible for half (36% and 14%, respectively) of
all the reported national outlays.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, HIV/AIDS control is primarily sustained by public
investment. Between 1997 and 2000, funding from federal and
regional governments has remained relatively stable. As was shown
in the National Accounts study, the flow of public resources
accounted for 75.6% of the total AIDS funding in 1998 and
increased slightly to 79.7% in 2000.<sup>5,8</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interestingly, a decline was observed in relation to federal
resources allocated for AIDS as a proportion of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP). In 1999, federal AIDS expenditures represented
approximately 0.079% of Brazilian GDP, declining in subsequent
years to 0.06%, 0.055% and, finally, to 0.05% (2004). Thus, a
decrease of 36.7% was observed in HIV/AIDS spending as a
proportion of GDP between 1999 and 2004. These data indicate that
HIV/AIDS outlay has increased at levels inferior to the growth of
Brazilian GDP during this period and was also inferior to the
international average.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In absolute cost, 
  the federal public expenditure for HIV/AIDS was of R$943.9 million<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
  in 2001 and R$800.2 million in 2002, which represented 3.7% and 3.2% of the 
  total Ministry in Health spending in actions and services (excluding payments 
  for retirees and debt services).<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
  Preliminary estimates reveal that, in 2003, these expenses were of R$853 million, 
  which was equivalent to 3.14% of the total Ministry of Health (MH) spending. 
  Thus, as a percentage of MH expenditures, the cost of AIDS control, although 
  declining, comprises a significant proportion of the budget.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Purchases of anti-retroviral medication represented 78.1% and
63.2% of all HIV-related resources allocated by the federal
government in 2001 and 2002, respectively. This spending equaled
approximately 60% of the nearly R$ 840 million appropriated by
the MH to strategic medication in 2000, and approximately 20% of
total spending for pharmaceutical assistance in Brazil during
this same year.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>TARGETS ASSOCIATED 
  WITH THE BEHAVIOR OF INTERNATIONAL FUNDING SOURCES</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this group, some targets apply to efforts by some countries
to contribute funds to low per-capita income nations. The
budgetary limitations of medium per-capita income countries, as
is the case with Brazil, restrict their capacity to provide funds
or material donations and it is thus unrealistic to expect a
significant contribution from these countries. Therefore, the
largest share of contributions needed to reach this target falls
to developed countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This argument does not exempt developing nations (such as
Brazil) from their declared commitments, but rather induces them
to act primarily to suggest and monitor: collective actions,
policies to be implemented by developed countries, strategies to
be adopted by multilateral organizations and programs that
provide technical assistance. In this respect, Brazil has been
deeply involved internationally. This engagement has resulted in
significant progress in fighting the epidemic and promoted
cooperation with less-developed countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other targets are associated with international funding
commitments that can be provided to Brazil. In such cases, it is
up to the Brazilian government to explore ways to better conform
to the eligibility criteria for reception of these resources.
This does not imply that completion for resources should exist
with countries severely affected by HIV/AIDS and without
financial conditions to confront its costs. Rather, Brazil should
adapt to the eligibility criteria for international funding
grants and loans allocated to poverty and, primarily, those
targeting unequal distribution of income. This will focus
attention on the country's needs, and thus induce a regional
increase in available resources.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International HIV/AIDS funding may, initially, seem to be a
generous handout to poor countries. However, a more detailed
analysis shows that the increase in international contributions
has been extremely small. Despite a confirmed rise, official
assistance for poverty reduction, through which the majority of
international resources directed to HIV/AIDS are channeled,
represents only 0.24% of the Gross Domestic Product of donor
countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If developed countries were to attain their donation
commitment of 0.7% of GDP, international funding could be
significantly increased: from approximately US$ 53 billion to US$
175 billion in 2001. This would increase the availability of
funds for health and, consequently, for HIV/AIDS initiatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The monetary value 
  of contributions used to combat HIV/AIDS is, without a doubt, lower than the 
  resulting benefits of their investment. The recognition that managing this disease 
  is a global public good can further the negotiations for increased development 
  assistance and for more favorable financing conditions, thus broadening the 
  international contribution in the fight against the epidemic. <sup>12,</sup> 
  <a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Poverty reduction programs have been accepted as a global
public good for a relatively longer time and, consequently,
already receive substantial resources. Endeavors to secure
HIV/AIDS funding may benefit from the disease's close association
with poverty, particularly in Brazil, where approximately one
third of the population (54 million persons) is considered poor.
This factor, combined with substantial unequal distribution of
income, makes Brazil particularly eligible for these funds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recognition that the fight against AIDS is a global public
good leads to another question: what is considered an equitable
distribution of aid among donor countries toward this global
good? <sup>14</sup> Here, two Official Development Assistance
(ODA) resource flows are required: traditional bilateral
assistance to fund national and local initiatives and another to
fund global priorities. The understanding of the geographical
reach of this assistance tends to revive the role of these
institutions and, consequently, attract new
resources.<sup>3</sup> Only in this way will it be possible to
define principles and an appropriate cost-sharing model for the
global public good as established by the
Declaration.<sup>10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An additional difficulty facing international HIV/AIDS
initiatives results from the absence of dialogue between donors.
This, in turn, leads to decreased efficiency in resource
distribution. In some cases, funds do not reach the countries in
most need and, in other instances, the delivery of funds is
delayed because of requirements of the donor agencies. Thus,
there is need for a critical analysis of the eligibility criteria
established by international funding bodies and of the primary
obstacles for delivery of these resources.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International loans are another source of frustration for
recipient states. Even when a country is eligible for funds, the
rigidity of financial terms often makes these resources inviable
alternatives. Moreover, the interest rates to be paid by the
indebted country are defined based on GDP and do not consider the
type of benefit (private, national or international) that the
funds will yield.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Human Development 
  Report of 2005<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a> of the United 
  Nations Development Program asserts that the world is heading toward a disaster 
  attributable to a lack of coordinated international effort. Three mechanisms 
  can better this situation: increased financial assistance, increased international 
  commerce and a resolution to armed conflicts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At issue are not only increases in funding, but also the
guarantee of their long-term sustainability and the strengthening
of national governments through, among other instruments,
expanded commerce. Shifts in priorities relating to political
questions and resulting from armed conflicts lead to inefficient
and uncertain allocation of resources. These preclude proper
planning for the medium to long-term initiatives that are
indispensable for population health.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>TARGET ASSOCIATED 
  WITH DEBT-FORGIVENESS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a 1999 estimate<sup>1</sup>, only 8.5% of the total
resources made available as a result of debt-forgiveness were
allocated to health. No estimates exist of how much of this was
specifically directed to HIV/AIDS programs, but it is believed
that these funds could be better administered since countries
with the most significant epidemics are also the
poorest.<sup>13</sup> The inclusion of HIV/AIDS projects in
debt-forgiveness initiatives will rely on a demonstrated
relationship between the epidemic and poverty and the adequate
implementation of poverty-control strategies in national HIV/AIDS
programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this respect, 
  the debt-forgiveness initiative for poorer countries has encountered severe 
  criticisms. Titled Debt Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries - HIPC 
  Initiative, this was launched in 1996 by the World Bank and the International 
  Monetary Fund and includes the largest international creditors. Complaints include 
  the fact that only a portion of the entire debt is forgiven and, oftentimes, 
  the amount to be repaid is higher than the health and education expenditures 
  of these countries.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> Furthermore, 
  the policies implemented in order to reach fiscal targets and balanced payments 
  decrease the resources available for poverty reduction and other national social 
  programs.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>TARGET ASSOCIATED 
  WITH THE BEHAVIOR OF NATIONAL PUBLIC FUNDING</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data relating to public funding in Brazil, principally by
federal entities, confirms AIDS is a higher priority than other
diseases. This is obvious from the proportion of the budget
allocated to this illness by the MH, particularly toward expenses
associated with pharmaceutical assistance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although this position is unlikely to change, it is notable
that from 1999 to 2002 the financial sustainability HIV/AIDS
initiatives was only maintained, in relative terms, because of a
12.8% reduction in federal public outlay for combating AIDS and
as a result of loan agreements with the World Bank, which
consolidated expenses with the available budget.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Factors responsible for the reduced expenditures during these
years were:</font></p>

>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even if present 
  conditions are maintained, the price reduction of costly treatment items, as 
  was seen until 2002, will not be sustained. This decrease in spending resulted, 
  in part, from inaccuracies in the standardized prices of services provided by 
  the welfare system (<i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> - SUS), which 
  includes the remuneration of hospital stays, tests and blood sorting. The 13.5% 
  inflation rate of 2001 and the stable cost of HIV diagnostic tests led to further 
  lowering of prices in 2002.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was also a 
  consequence of the significant decrease in the price of antiretroviral medications 
  (a prerequisite for the success of universal access policies<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8">8</a></sup>) 
  which, among other factors, resulted from: increased domestic production of 
  generics, importation of medications, centralized purchasing through the MH 
  and the adoption of price regulation policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this context, several factors can constrain funding. These
include: difficulties in maintaining the tendency of decreasing
prices, the incorporation each year of thousands of persons
needing antiretroviral therapy, the rise in patient survival and
the increased diagnostic testing needed to control transmission
of the disease.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To confront this situation, in addition to the allocation of
additional resources, new policies must be implemented that
impact HIV/AIDS costs and increase the sum of resources
available. The long-term sustainability of the Brazilian program
for manufacturing antiretroviral medication, and generics in
general, is conditioned on reducing the country's dependence on
imported pharmachemicals. This will require substantial
investment for the reconstruction of the debilitated national
industrial park.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additional investment in research and development of new
products that contribute significantly to HIV/AIDS spending is
also imperative. The sheer size of this input is a significant
obstacle to the development of medications by individual
developing countries. In light of this, specialists promote the
creation of a global fund for research as a means to overcome
these financial limitations and address health issues
particularly relevant to developing countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to reduce the price of medications, it is also
necessary to exploit the flexibility inherent in the
International Trade-related aspects of intellectual property
rights. Government-issued licenses for new medication, for
example, can reduce the expense involved in their purchase. This
possibility has been endorsed in legislation and in international
agreements to which Brazil is party.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to guarantee the allocation of additional AIDS
resources, the discussion on funding should emphasize not only
increased contributions by the MH, but, principally, increased
health funding as a whole. In addition, Constitutional Amendment
nº 29 of 2000 (which modified article 198 of the Federal
Constitution) should be enforced and Complementary Law nº 01
of 2003 (which regulates the linkage of health funds) should be
used to settle existing contentions relating to the amount and
distribution of the limited federal health resources. In this
way, more funding will be channeled to the fight against
AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a broader context, this discussion concerns the economic
policies that recently have relegated social issues to lower
priorities, a phenomenon increasingly observed in Latin America.
For example, the monetary policy, which is cast in high interest
rates, overly burdens debt services and compromises the use of
resources in social programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In light of scare resources, it is crucial that investments be
made in initiatives that are both cost-effective and produce few
negative consequences. These programs should incorporate the
relation between prevention and treatment since it is
inappropriate to calculate treatment costs without also
considering the impact of antiretroviral therapy in reducing HIV
transmission.<sup>6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is also important to stress transparency in the use of
resources. This is contingent on the availability of reliable
information on funding levels and resource flow. The periodic
standardization of HIV/AIDS funding and expenditure data will
streamline spending and identify, more precisely and
transparently, deficits in sector and geographic resources. This
will facilitate decision-making at the national and international
levels.</font></p>
