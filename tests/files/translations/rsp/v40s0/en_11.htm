<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paper critically analyzes, from the gender standpoint,
official results presented in the Brazilian government report to
the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).
Specifically, the fulfillment of 2003 targets set forth in the
United Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, under the
category of <i>Human Rights and Reduction of the Economic and
Social Impact of AIDS</i>, are evaluated. Key concepts are
highlighted, including indicators and strategies that may help
civilian society better monitor these targets until 2010.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>PUBLIC HEALTH, 
  HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ANALYSIS OF GENDER ON THE LEGAL PHENOMENON</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The association of public health to human rights is
fundamental for successful health policies. As it relates to
AIDS, this relationship is evidenced by the government HIV/AIDS
program and by the thousands of non-governmental organization
(NGO) projects publicly financed during the last 20 years. These
are fundamental for an efficient Brazilian response to the
epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mann et al<sup>4</sup> explains three basic relationships
between the concepts of public health and human rights, initially
considering the potential impact of health policies, programs and
practices on human rights. This relationship illustrates the
complementary nature of public health targets and human rights
norms in the conduct of effective health policies and programs.
The second relationship affirms that the "violation or
non-enforcement of one or all human rights negatively affects
physical and mental health and is detrimental to the social
wellbeing"<i>.</i> The last analogy emphasizes the necessary
interaction between notions of public health and human rights
through which the "promotion and protection of health require
explicit and concrete efforts to promote and protect human
rights, much as the earnest fulfillment of human rights requires
profound attention to health and to the social determinants
therein implicated".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS are
complex social processes that have developed during historical
periods of rapid social and economic changes. Since the late
1970s, the radical restructuring of the world economy has been
characterized by accelerated processes of social exclusion. These
reinforce preexisting inequalities such as racism, homophobia,
misogyny, ethnic discrimination and religious conflicts. The
interaction between these factors offers a general model for the
analysis of the multiple forms of discrimination that typify the
HIV/AIDS pandemic. An example of this was the recognition of the
relationship between HIV/AIDS and the homosexual lifestyle prior
to the epidemic, which provoked tragic consequences at the start
of the 1980s in the United States when research on the virus was
compromised because of the homosexual prejudice.<sup>6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1988, the World 
  Health Organization initiated a more effective decision-making apparatus designed 
  to protect the human rights of HIV/AIDS-infected persons through resolution 
  41.24.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> This recognized the 
  need to incorporate to national AIDS prevention and control programs, as well 
  as to individual countries' own global strategies, respect for the human rights 
  of persons living with HIV/AIDS and of other groups vulnerable to infection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Significantly, 
  in 2000, the "National AIDS Programmes &#150; A Guide to Monitoring and Evaluation" 
  discussed, in item 3.3, "Stigma and Discrimination"<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>, 
  stating that these can turn the lives of infected persons insufferable and also 
  impact prevention and care initiatives. Likewise, the 2002/2003 campaign of 
  the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) had as its primary objective 
  the prevention, reduction and elimination of the stigma and discrimination provoked 
  by AIDS.<sup>1</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2001, the countries meeting for the 26<sup>th</sup> United
Nations General Assembly Special Session committed to combat
HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) by adopting measures to confront the epidemic
and the principal global problems associated with it. The result
of this Special Session was the Declaration of Commitment on
HIV/AIDS, to which Brazil is signatory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present article critically evaluates the response of the
Brazilian Ministry of Health (through the National Program for
STD/AIDS ) to human rights and reduction of the social and
economic impacts of HIV/AIDS from 2001-2003. This was done in the
light of what is stated in the United Nations Declaration of
Commitment on HIV/AIDS and adopting the analysis of gender on the
legal phenomenon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Accepting law science as a debating position and androcentrism
as an ideology to be overcome, it is apparent that the
androcentric emphasis exerts a strong influence on the notion of
equality in relation to the law. Facio<sup>2</sup> considers
that, in many cases, specific legislation confers special
protection at the same time that it reduces the idea of legal
equality. For example, in women's reproductive health, sexual
discrimination can never be eliminated based only on special
legislation. This understanding would restrict the notion of
equality (considering the difference between the sexes) before
the law to an "equivalence to everything that is not related to
reproduction of the species and a difference between women and
men in all aspects related to this unique function". With this,
the recognition of values that serve as the basis for the
traditional concept of equality (and of human rights) guarantees,
in theory, that only men can be treated as complete human beings
because man was considered as the paradigm of the human
being.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis of gender also considers the vast feminist
experience in monitoring public policies and in the conduct of
advocacy strategies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concept of advocacy is basic to understanding the role of
civil society in this process and is not related to so-called
social control, which has specific legislation derived from Law
8.080/90 and addresses community participation in Health
Councils. Advocacy considers an initiative originating in civil
society and directed toward the State, either through judicial
action, political discourse with the government and partner
members of parliament, or dialogue with the media and with the
corporate sector (a process still in its infancy in Brazil).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From this methodological landmark, it is possible to evaluate
if the public policies and norms outlined in the Brazilian report
can contribute to decreasing discrimination and increasing
empowerment of women and girls, which is the emphasis of the
UNGASS Declaration of Commitment for the period 2005 to 2010.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis of 
  the Brazilian government data made use of the official document presented to 
  the United Nations in 2002<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
  and reference documents from discussion forums produced by organized civil society.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>MONITORING BY 
  NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE EMPHASIS ON GENDER</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UNGASS Declaration of Commitment originates from the
definition of a series of models reinforced historically by
Brazilian activism in HIV/AIDS and human rights. Among these are:
the association between strategies to reduce vulnerability and
protection of human rights, related to prevention and assistance;
the consideration of themes related to economic and social
development as human rights questions; the access to care and
prevention as human rights; and increased efficacy of the
government response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic at the urging of
civil society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indicators used to evaluate the participation of civil society
in the elaboration of the Brazilian government report included in
the report model of UNAIDS are limited to asking whether or not
the society has participated. The subsequent challenge is the
evaluation and recording of the quality of civil society
participation using its own indicators, which are defined during
the developmental process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Declaration of Commitment targets for human rights for the
period between 2003 and 2005 address questions directly related
to the rights of women and girls.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There exists a 
  belief that women, particularly girls, are vulnerable as a consequence of the 
  negation of their rights, gender inequality, social factors, cultural and economic 
  factors, biology and commonplace violence, and that their empowerment should 
  be the basis of a multi-agency response to the global pandemic. In order to 
  address this issue, a document formulated by the International Coalition for 
  Women's Health was presented to the Brazilian government in March 2006. This 
  was signed by dozens of international NGOs involved in HIV/AIDS, including the 
  Brazilian Interdisciplinary Association for AIDS and Gestos.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Coalition organized a meeting in Bangkok in November 2005
and aims to contribute to the content of the "Resolution on Women
and HIV/AIDS", which is presently being drafted by the United
Nations. The principal aims proposed in the document include:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INDICATIONS 
  FOR A GENDER ANALYSIS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian report 
  relied on four global indicators to address human rights, according to the Declaration 
  of Commitment and other appended documents,<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a> 
  to verify: if countries have enacted laws and regulations protecting from discrimination 
  persons living with HIV/AIDS and groups identified as particularly vulnerable 
  to the virus; if there exist policies that assure equal access to prevention 
  and care for both men and women; and if there exist policies mandating that 
  ethics committees revise and approve protocols for HIV/AIDS research on humans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first issue 
  highlighted by the report is the inadequacy of the indicators proposed by UNAIDS 
  for the elaboration of the country reports, particularly in initiatives relating 
  to human rights. This may be a result of the model used by UNAIDS to formulate 
  its basic indicators, the objective of which is to "maximize the validity, the 
  internal coherence and the between-country and chronological comparisons of 
  the calculations of the indicators obtained, as well as assuring coherence in 
  the types of data and calculation methods used."<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> 
  The attempt to establish a comparative model between countries appears to have 
  obscured certain human rights initiatives that exist in Brazil but are sill 
  not practiced in other countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, the majority of questions developed based on these
indicators, which were answered in the Brazilian report,
influence laws and regulations that have established determined
policies relating to persons living with HIV/AIDS and populations
vulnerable to the virus, emphasizing women and girls. However,
this information alone cannot demonstrate the efficacy of the
judicial norms listed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This suggests there is a need to develop qualitative studies
relating to human rights and HIV/AIDS. One such case study was
based on the jurisprudence of requests for HIV/AIDS medication
recently published by the National Program for STD/AIDS of the
Ministry of Health.<sup>5</sup> This evaluated approximately 450
judicial decisions derived from law courts of the twenty-seven
Brazilian states by analyzing the capacity of the judicial
authority to influence the free distribution of HIV/AIDS
medication.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the human rights commitments adopted obligates states
to "eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence, including
traditional practices and abuse, rape and other forms of sexual
violence, maltreatment or trafficking of women and girls".
However, on this item, the Declaration of Commitment limits the
topic of gender violence to an issue of female training,
suggesting that it showed be incorporated into educational
initiatives. This measure is undoubtedly necessary, but is unable
to address scenarios emerging from deep-rooted cultural
questions, particularly relating to traditional rituals and
practices imposed on girls (e.g. female circumcision practiced in
fundamentalist cultures). This theme also incorporates
controversial and complicated theoretical issues such as cultural
relativism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, it is widely recognized that the rates of HIV
infection are increasing faster in women (and girls) then men.
This reinforces the importance of incentives such as those
adopted by the International Coalition for Women's Health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The components of human rights and reduction of socioeconomic
impact comprising the Brazilian report are analyzed individually
below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Human rights</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following questions 
  were answered by the Brazilian government, in relation to the human rights commitments, 
  in the period from January to December 2002:<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>1. Does your country have laws and regulations that protect
persons living with HIV/AIDS from discrimination (for example,
legal clauses relating to non-discrimination other than those
addressing issues of housing, education, work)</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The answer to this question mentions all the constitutional
regulations and general legislation in existence since 1988,
including laws, inter-ministerial regulations and other
legislation leading to 2002.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In relation to innovations in this field, initiatives that
address the racial issue should comprise the next report. The
Ministry of Health has implemented relevant public policies,
including the drafting of Decree Nº 4.228 on May 13 2002,
which instituted the National Program for Affirmative Action at
the Federal Public Administration level. Likewise, World AIDS Day
of 2005 in Brazil had as its theme AIDS and racism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There exist new regulations relating to discrimination based
on sexual orientation that should be incorporated into the new
report, corresponding to the years following its drafting:</font></p>

</table>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Non-governmental 
  organizations working with AIDS and the diverse related networks, particularly 
  persons with HIV/AIDS, sex workers and homosexuals, have monitored the execution 
  of public AIDS initiatives using different advocacy strategies. This has included, 
  for example, cooperation with the Federal Public Ministry to define responses 
  to violations of the law by governments; although this still occurs with limited 
  frequency, and almost always induced by a formal request. The dialogue of organized 
  civil society with the higher levels of the Federal Public Ministry may potentially 
  resolve regional or national problems by sensitizing authorities to the impact 
  of human rights violations on HIV/AIDS public health policies. Representatives 
  of the Ministry of Health at the state level can also be advised more systematically 
  by civil society in order to guarantee the rights of persons living with HIV/AIDS 
  at the local level.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The policy adopted by Brazilian NGOs in order to contribute to
the elaboration of legislation and in the debates relating to the
budget and the requests for interventions from parliament members
was consolidated by parliamentary groups<i>.</i> The advocacy
strategy supported by the federal government was not mentioned in
the Brazilian report because there are no indicators for this
initiative. Initiatives derived from this strategy may be
effective indicators of participation by civil society in the
monitoring process of UNGASS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The parliamentary caucus to combat HIV/AIDS first convened in
the National Congress in 2001 and analogous local groups were
created between 2003 and 2005 in several Brazilian states through
the combined efforts of UNAIDS, the Brazilian government and NGO
Forums that develop AIDS initiatives. In 2004, there were 66
ongoing law projects in the National Congress relating to themes
including: prohibition of discrimination against
HIV/AIDS-positive persons, medication patents for prevention and
care of AIDS, extension of continuous benefits (defined in the
legislation as available to elderly and impaired persons,
irrespective of their contribution to the welfare system) to
carriers of HIV, distribution of food rations (<i>cesta
b&aacute;sica</i>) in health care units and employment security
for infected persons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notable in relation to social rights is discriminatory
treatment in the admission, maintenance and termination of
employment. In addition to the Regional Labor Offices that
comprise the network charged with implanting Convention 111 of
the International Labour Organization (which coordinates the
combat against racism and all forms of discrimination in the
workplace), doctors and employment inspectors should also be
given more attention, in the framework of an advocacy strategy to
address this issue. The Public Ministry of Labor and the
corporate sector have limited dialogue among each other as well
as with organized civil society, particularly relating to public
policies undertaken by the federal government. It is fundamental
to include each of these as partners in the monitoring program of
the UNGASS targets.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>2. Does your country have laws and regulations that protect
groups identified as vulnerable to HIV/AIDS-related
discrimination (for example: intravenous drug users, men who have
sex with other men, sex workers, young persons, migrant
populations and prison populations)</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the document analyzed, the Brazilian government responded
to this question with a description of initiatives and of federal
legislation related to the national anti-drug policy. Also
mentioned were constitutional devices related to fundamental
rights and guarantees, in addition to municipal legislation
related to homophobia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In relation to policies addressing stigma and discrimination
<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> sexual orientation, it is notable that,
in addition to Program Brazil without Homophobia, there was
active participation from the National Program for STD/AIDS and
the National Council to Combat Discrimination. The latter is
linked to the Special Secretary on Human Rights to the President
of the Republic and has recently begun addressing violence
against activists in the gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual
movement. The Ministry of Culture also participated in Program
Brazil without Homophobia through Decree 219 of July 23 2004.
This created the Workgroup for the Promotion of Gay, Lesbian,
Transgender and Bisexual Citizenship, composed of representatives
of the Ministry of Culture, the National Council to Combat
Discrimination and the Brazilian Association of Gay, Lesbian and
Transgender Persons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Decree nº 1,777 of September 9 2003, instituted the
National Health Plan for the Prison System. This program operates
in conjunction with the National Program for STD/AIDS in the
prison system through a workgroup composed of several units of
the National Program, the Hepatitis Program and the Technical
Area for Health in the Prison System. The principle of this
initiative focuses on the decentralization process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>3. "Does your country have a policy that guarantees equal

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reply to this question also refers to constitutional
regulation and the general legislation in existence since 1988.
The advantage of this topic is that the descriptions of the
policies implemented are explicitly themed, which increases the

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Issues involving 
  the concession of welfare and social benefits occupy a large portion of the 
  judicial case loads brought about by NGOs that develop AIDS initiatives. This 
  is followed by requests related to worker's rights and access to medication.<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a> 
  These data confirm the importance of social policies, such as those addressing 
  hunger and poverty, which are still in their infancy in Brazil. Similarly, the 
  recent incentives policy directed at states and municipalities for the development 
  of HIV/AIDS initiatives (Decree nº 2,313/02 and alterations) should 
  be highlighted as essential for the successful decentralization of HIV/AIDS 
  health policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is important to again emphasize the content of the document
drafted by the International Coalition for Women's Health. This
refers to the negative socioeconomic effects of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic and its wider impact on women and girls, and which
requires "increased funding for care and support to women", as
well as "promoting economic empowerment for women as a means to
reduce their vulnerability."</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fulfillment of the UNGASS targets has already consolidated
an important objective for social AIDS movements, Networks of
Person Living with HIV/AIDS and NGOs that develop AIDS
initiatives in Brazil. This reinforces the need for training and
empowerment of more leaders to complete this undertaking at the
national and international levels, particularly as it relates to
the creation of new international mechanisms for the protection
of human rights and of the societal control of public
policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The stimulation of new advocacy strategies and responses to
discrimination associated with HIV and AIDS resulting from the
evaluation process of the fulfillment of the UNGASS targets by
civil society are considered fundamental. This ongoing initiative
will produce favorable effects on actions related to human rights
and the reduction of social and economic impacts of HIV/AIDS, in
the formulation of policies and in the planning of initiatives
for the National Program. This also points to the need to
maintain the general direction adopted by the Brazilian
government, beginning with the integration of public initiatives
guaranteeing human rights and the prevention and care of
HIV/AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judicial or political interventions driven by the actions of
NGOs, of the network of persons living with AIDS and of the
organized groups that are more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infection
in Brazil have shown a significant capacity to minimize the
negative impact of the stigma and discrimination associated with
HIV/AIDS.<sup>6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis of the components of the Brazilian report to the
United Nations (until 2003) in relation to Human Rights and
Social and Economic Impact reveals a need to establish new
indicators that can make state actions in these areas more
evident, such as guaranteeing the rights of more vulnerable
populations or rights in the workplace, as well as encouraging a
critical evaluation of societal participation in the formulation
of policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The feminist experience should be better clarified for the NGO
movement working with AIDS initiatives and networks engaged in
the monitoring of UNGASS. This is especially opportune because
some targets refer explicitly to public initiatives in the field
of sexual and reproductive health in terms of gender, for which
the feminist movement possesses clear proposals. Similarly, the
AIDS NGO movement and the Networks contribute to feminist
principles, including those related to the possible integration
of agendas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The link between theory and practice resulting from the
involvement of HIV/AIDS activists in academic and governmental
dialogue, in theoretical, technical and financial exchanges
between health-related sectors of the government and the feminist
and black movements, NGOs and networks of sex workers,
homosexuals, and persons living with AIDS, will certainly provide
a positive foundation for the social responses still necessary to
combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</font></p>
